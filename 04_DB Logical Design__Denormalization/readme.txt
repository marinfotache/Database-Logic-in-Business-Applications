The zip files contain the archive associated to an ODM model.

1) On your computer please create a main ODM directory.

2) Download and copy in this directory the following files:
- `defaultdomains.xml`
- `types.xml`

3) In Oracle Data Modeler, go to `Preferences` -> `Data Modeler` and set first four directories on
  your main ODM directory.

4) All the models are zipped (since they have large numbers of files).
Each model will be downloaded into the main ODM directory and unzipped.

5) Alfter unzipping, open the model by choosing the .dmd file
